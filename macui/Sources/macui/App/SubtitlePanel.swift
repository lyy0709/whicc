/// logic, which is what was causing the y-axis jump with the old
/// `didResizeNotification` approach).
///
/// `onWillClose` lets the controller hook the panel's close button
/// so it can shut down the local backend (whicc.py / translate_stream /
/// glossary_refresher / whicc-audio) in addition to just hiding the
/// panel. Without this hook, clicking the red close button would
/// only hide the panel — `applicationWillTerminate` doesn't fire
/// when the user closes the only window via the close button.
